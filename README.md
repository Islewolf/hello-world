Hello, world!

I'm currently learning pixel art. I joined github so I can compile aseprite, a sprite editor.
My hobbies include playing guitar, making crappy music on FL Studio and wasting time spreading myself to thin.
In the past, I've tried to learn C++, 3ds Max, Flash, Adobe Premier Pro and countless gamedev IDEs among other things.

SoaD, QotSA, Gorillaz, Haken, Muse and IM is teh shit.
